# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢📊
- Project Overview
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset, analyzing passenger survival rates based on various factors like age, gender, class, and fare. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, we visualize trends and correlations to uncover key insights about survival probabilities.
# Technologies Used
- Python 
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
# Key Objectives 🎯
- Understand survival distribution among passengers.
- Identify key factors influencing survival rates.
- Analyze demographic patterns using visualizations.
-Compare survival rates across different ticket classes.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 📊
- Survival Rate: Percentage of passengers who survived.
- Survival by Class: How passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) affected survival.
- Survival by Gender: Comparing male vs. female survival rates.
- Age Distribution: Survival chances across different age groups.
- Family Influence: Impact of traveling with family on survival probability.

# Project Insights 🔍
- 📌 Gender & Survival:
Females had a significantly higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~18%).
This aligns with the "Women and children first" protocol.

- 📌 Class & Survival:
1st-class passengers had the highest survival rate (~63%), while 3rd-class had the lowest (~24%).
Higher-class passengers had better access to lifeboats.

- 📌 Age Factor:
Children (ages 0-10) had a better survival rate (~58%) compared to adults.
Elderly passengers had the lowest survival chances.

- 📌 Family Influence:
Passengers with small families had a higher survival rate than solo travelers.
Large families had lower chances due to limited lifeboat availability.

# Conclusion 🏁
📢 This analysis confirms that gender, class, and age were major survival determinants on the Titanic. Women, children, and first-class passengers had the highest survival rates, highlighting socio-economic disparities and safety protocols followed during the disaster.

# Future Scope 🚀
- Apply Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict survival probability.
- Perform Feature Engineering to extract more meaningful insights.
- Build an interactive Power BI Dashboard for better visualization.
